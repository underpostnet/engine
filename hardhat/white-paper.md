### 1. Executive Summary

<a name="header-1.1"/>

#### 1.1 Brief overview of the whitepaper and its key findings

This whitepaper introduces "Cyberian Frontier Tokenomics", a decentralized solution for player progression in the MMORPG "Cyberia Online." We propose a blockchain-based system built on Hyperledger Besu that leverages Ethereum Request for Comment (ERC), Protocol that provides guidelines for creating tokens and smart contracts, and for data formatting and transmission on the Ethereum ecosystem, in this case for in-game currency and item ownership.

**Key Findings**

- **Player Ownership:** By leveraging ERC-721 standards, Itemledger.com (IL), tokens can represent unique in-game items in Cyberia Online. Owning all ERC-721 tokens associated with a public key allows for full reconstruction of a character's game state, including their inventory and equipment.
- **Decentralized Economy:** ERC-20 tokens, represented by Cryptokoyn.net (CKY), serve as the in-game currency for Cyberia Online. This allows players to hold their character's coin balance on a secure and transparent blockchain ledger.
- **Open Ecosystems:** External developers can potentially leverage character data and validate authenticity for future innovations.

The following sections will delve deeper into the technical aspects, game mechanics, and economic benefits of this decentralized approach.

**The Rise of Multi-Platform Gaming, Procedural algorithms, and AI Content Generation**

The gaming industry has experienced explosive growth in recent years, driven by the proliferation of mobile devices and the increasing demand for cross-platform gaming experiences (<a target="_top" href='https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/future-crossplay-gaming-demand.html'>1</a>,<a target="_top" href='https://unity.com/resources/gaming-report'>2</a>,<a target="_top" href='https://www.servers.com/news/blog/is-cross-platform-the-future-of-gaming'>3</a>,<a target="_top" href='https://www.servers.com/news/blog/my-6-big-takeaways-from-gdc-2023'>4</a>). Games like _Albion Online_ (<a target="_top" href='https://www.affinitymediagroup.co/albion'>case study</a>) have demonstrated the potential of non-linear MMORPGs by allowing players to build their own economies and explore vast virtual worlds.

A key factor in this growth has been the adoption of procedural content generation technologies. Games such as _Minecraft_ (<a target="_top" href='https://www.kodeby.com/blog/post/exploring-the-impact-of-procedural-generation-in-modern-game-development-techniques'>source</a>) have popularized the idea of randomly generated worlds, offering players unique and infinite experiences. These technologies, combined with advancements in artificial intelligence, have democratized content creation in video games.

**Artificial Intelligence and Content Generation**

Large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models are innovative way how content is created for video games. These AI tools enable the rapid and efficient generation of:

- **Stories and scripts:** LLMs can create compelling and personalized narratives for each player.
- **Art assets:** Diffusion models generate a wide variety of art assets, such as characters, environments, and objects, at a significantly lower cost than traditional methods.
- **Virtual worlds:** The combination of LLMs and diffusion models enables the creation of coherent and dynamic virtual worlds, where every element is interconnected and responds to player actions.

#### 2.2 Problem Statement: Need for a Decentralized Solution for Player Progression

Traditional MMORPGs often struggle to strike a balance between player ownership, transparency, and a healthy in-game economy (<a target="_top" href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10585540'>source</a>). Centralized servers controlled by game developers raise concerns about:

- **Lack of Ownership:** Players may invest significant time and resources into building characters and acquiring items, but ultimately lack true ownership of these digital assets. Server shutdowns or changes in game rules can erase player progress.
- **Opacity and Manipulation:** Game developers hold significant power over in-game economies, potentially manipulating item value or introducing pay-to-win mechanics that erode trust and fairness.
- **Security Risks:** Centralized servers can be vulnerable to hacks or exploits, jeopardizing player data and in-game assets.

This whitepaper proposes a solution: a **decentralized player progression system** built on blockchain technology. This system aims to address the limitations of traditional MMORPGs by offering:

- **Verifiable Ownership:** Players hold their characters and items as digital assets on a distributed ledger, ensuring tamper-proof progression and true ownership.
- **Transparency and Trust:** Smart contracts automate game mechanics and token issuance, creating a transparent and verifiable system that players can trust.
- **Secure and Thriving Economy:** Blockchain technology provides a secure platform for in-game transactions and item trading, fostering a robust and player-driven economy.

By implementing a distributed solution, Cyberian Frontier aims to empower players, create a fair and transparent gaming environment, and innovative MMORPG experience.

- **ERC721Enumerable:** Extends ERC721 to allow enumerating all tokens and tokens owned by a specific owner.
- **ERC721Burnable:** Extends ERC721 to allow token holders to burn their tokens.
- **Ownable:** Provides ownership and access control mechanisms.

**Constructor:**

- **Initializes the contract:** Sets the token name and symbol.
- **Assigns ownership:** Grants ownership to the specified initial owner.

**Functions:**

- **\_baseURI():** Defines the base URI for token metadata. In this case, it's set to 'IL'.
- **safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId):** Mints a new NFT to the specified address with the given token ID. Only the contract owner can call this function.

**Override Functions:**

The contract overrides several functions from the inherited contracts to ensure correct behavior:

- **\_update():** Updates token ownership information.
- **\_increaseBalance():** Updates the balance of a token owner.
- **supportsInterface():** Checks if the contract implements a specific interface.

**Key Points:**

- **Unique Items:** Each token represents a unique item, allowing for tracking ownership and provenance.
- **Ownership Control:** The `Ownable` contract ensures that only the designated owner can mint new NFTs.
- **Token Metadata:** The `_baseURI()` function sets the base URI for token metadata, which can be used to store additional information about each item.
- **Flexibility:** The `ERC721Enumerable` and `ERC721Burnable` features provide additional functionalities for managing and controlling NFTs.

This smart contract creates a flexible and secure platform for managing unique items. It can be used for various applications, such as digital collectibles, in-game items, or real-world asset tokenization.

<a name="header-4.3"/>

#### 4.3 Token distribution and Allocation

**Cryptokoyn.net (CKY)**

- **Total Supply:** 10,000,000 CKY
- **Initial Allocation:**
  - **90% Airdrop and Mint Pool:** A significant portion will be allocated to an airdrop pool and a minting pool to distribute tokens to a wider audience.
  - **10% Direct Investor Wallets:** Directly distributed to investor wallets proportionally to their financial participation.

**Itemledger.com (IL)**

- **Total Supply:** Variable, based on the number of unique in-game items created.
- **Distribution:**
  - **In-Game Activities:** Players can earn IL tokens by completing specific quests, achievements, or participating in special events.
  - **Crafting:** Players can craft unique items and mint corresponding IL tokens, adding to the overall supply.
  - **Marketplace Trading:** IL tokens can be freely traded on NFT marketplaces, allowing players to acquire desired items or monetize their in-game achievements.

**Token Mechanics:**

- **Token Burning:** Only tokens held in the Coinbase address can be burned. This mechanism can be used to adjust the token supply and potentially increase token value.
- **Staking:**
  - **Asset Freezing:** Staked assets are frozen, meaning they cannot be used for other purposes while they are staked.
  - **Voting Rights:** The weight or influence of a vote is directly proportional to the amount of staked tokens and the duration of the staking period. This ensures that long-term commitment to the project is rewarded and that larger stakeholders have a greater say in the project's future.

This revised token distribution and allocation plan aims to provide a more balanced approach, considering both community engagement and investor interests. By incorporating airdrops, minting pools, and staking mechanisms, the project can foster a strong and active community while ensuring the long-term viability of the CKY token.

## Voting System Formula

**Formula:**

```
Vote Weight = 0.5 * (Amount Staked / Total Staked Amount) + 0.5 * (Staking Duration / Max Staking Duration)
```

**Explanation:**

- **Amount Staked:** The quantity of tokens a user has staked.
- **Total Staked Amount:** The total amount of tokens staked across all users.
- **Staking Duration:** The length of time for which the tokens are locked in staking.
- **Max Staking Duration:** The maximum allowable staking duration.

This formula ensures that both the amount of tokens staked and the duration of the staking period contribute equally to the voting weight. A user who stakes a larger amount of tokens for a longer period will have a higher voting weight.

## Item Incubation and Minting

### Incubation Time

- **Variable Incubation:** The incubation time for an item earned in-game can vary based on its characteristics. For example, rarer or more powerful items might have longer incubation periods.
- **Active Time:** The incubation period is essentially the time the item is actively used or held within the game.

### Minting and NFT Conversion

- **Earned In-Game Items:**
  - **Incubation Period:** Before these items can be exchanged for CKY tokens, they must undergo an incubation period based on their specific characteristics. This period ensures that players have actively engaged with the game and utilized the items.
- **Dropped or Default Items:**
  - **Incubation Period:** Farm, dropped, craft, and default items and must under go an incubation period before they can be converted into NFTs.
  - **Minting Cost:** To convert these items into NFTs, players must pay a minting fee in CKY tokens.

The voting system, combined with the staking mechanism, can effectively track and reward active players. By requiring a certain amount of staked tokens and a minimum staking duration to participate in governance, the system ensures that only active and committed community members have a significant influence on decision-making.

By implementing an incubation period and a minting fee, the game can control the supply of NFTs and prevent players from immediately selling off their newly acquired items without contributing to the game's ecosystem.
