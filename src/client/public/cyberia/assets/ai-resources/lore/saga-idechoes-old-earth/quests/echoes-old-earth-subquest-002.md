Key Changes and Explanations:

*   **`questId`:**  Changed to `echoes-old-earth-subquest-002` to follow the established numbering sequence.
*   **`displaySearchObjects`:**
    *   `rebel-scout-corpse`:  Represents the initial search objective.  Players will likely interact with multiple "corpse" objects, but only a few will yield the next item. The `searchDialog` provides in-game text for the search.
    *   `intact-comms-unit`: This is the key item players need to find.  Only *one* is required.
    *   `sera-rossi`:  The final delivery objective.  The `panelQuestIcons` now correctly reference a hypothetical `sera-rossi` icon.
*   **`reward`:**  Includes Zenith credits (as Kaito is a Zenith officer), basic repair kits (useful for any character), and a small amount of Atlas Confederation reputation (foreshadowing Sera's alignment and a potential reward for interacting with her).
*   **`provide`:** The `stepData` for `kaito-rossi` is updated to provide appropriate dialogue for each step of the quest, guiding the player. It now correctly directs the player to Kepler-186f.
*   **`icon`:** Changed to a more descriptive `comms-unit.png` within the `quest/echoes-old-earth` folder. This keeps the quest assets organized.
*   **`title` and `description`:**  More evocative and thematic, fitting the overall saga. The description provides more context and hints at the larger story. The Spanish translations are also updated. The descriptions emphasize that Kaito doesn't want you asking questions.
*   **`defaultDialog`**: Updated the default dialog.
* **Kepler-186f reference**: Added more information in quest log, about where find sera rossi.

This improved JSON creates a more engaging and logical quest within the "Echoes of the Old Earth" saga, building upon the existing lore and characters. It sets up future interactions and conflicts, and it's also game-mechanically sound. The use of different reward types and foreshadowing through reputation gain adds depth to the gameplay experience.
